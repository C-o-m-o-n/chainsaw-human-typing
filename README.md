# chainsaw-human-typing

Welcome to the chainsaw-human-typing repository! Chainsaw Human Typing is a tool that allows you to simulate human typing on a keyboard if you can't, or don't want to, paste directly. This is useful for simulating human typing in a video, for example.

## Getting Started 🚀

Simply download one a binary from the [releases](https://github.com/LyubomirT/chainsaw-human-typing/releases) page and run it. You can also build it yourself by cloning the repository and running `python main.py`.

## Usage 🛠

It's ️quite easy to use, actually! Just type the text you want to simulate typing in the input field and press the "Start Typing" button. The text will be typed out in the input field below. You can see the progress in the progress bar.
